# SecureStickyNotes
Code for the technical challenge in the Engineering 3 Class. The program is a Sticky Note program that is protected by a login system based on facial recognition. 
This allows users to store secure information in a way that is easily accessible but that data is also hidden from other people. 
In summary, it could be thought of a sticky note program protected with an Windows Hello login system.
